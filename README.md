# CDES:  Crowd Density Estimation System 
Sub project of [Covid ID](https://github.com/grewe/covid_id) dealing with Crowd Estimation using Computer vision and ML



[CrowdDetectionMeasurement](https://github.com/grewe/covidID_crowd/tree/master/CrowdDetectionMeasurement) = contains code and documentation for the CDM (crowd detection measurment) subsytem of the CDES.  This is a Learning Based DETECTION system to estimate crowd density

LearningBasedCrowdDensityMeasurement = contains code and documentation for LBCDM (learning based crowd density measurmeent) subsystem of CDES.  This is a Learning Based CLASSIFICATION system to estimate crowd density

PersonCountingMeasurement = contains code and documentation for PCM (person counting measurmeent) subsystem of CDES.  This is a person detection and coungin system to estimate crowd density
