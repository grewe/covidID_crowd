- Use both person counting and crowd density classification
	- Person counting vs. crowd density classification
		- Person counting
			- Person counting is more accurate with less people/lower crowd density
			- Person counting when crowd density is mid(higher end)-high
				- Pinpoint accurate headcount with higher density is not needed. A good estimation is sufficient to inform users whereas a
				label (low, mid, high) doesn't say as much.
				- Users can more easily determine for themselves whether X amount of people is too many people.
		- Crowd density
			- A label alone does not say much
			- What does low, mid, high density mean to the user?
