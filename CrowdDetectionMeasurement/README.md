## Data folder contains sample data and images used for training.

##FineTuneModel Directory contains all the checkpoints. There is also pipeline.config file which has all the configuration for training.

##SavedModel Training has final saved model which is used for conversion to tflite model.

## TFLite Directory contains python notebook for conversion of tflite model from saved model and also converted tflite model which is used for Android studio.

## [detectionEfficientdetD0Final.ipynb](https://github.com/grewe/covidID_crowd/blob/master/CrowdDetectionMeasurement/detectionEfficientnetD0Final.ipynb) This file contains whole training and setup of parameters for training.
